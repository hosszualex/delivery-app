# Flower Delivery App
This is very basic MVP of what an flower delivery app would look like. The app has 2 screens:
1. A list of all available orders. These orders are pulled from a mock API or if the phone has no internet connection, from an offline database which is updated regularly.
2. A details page where you can see more information on the order with the possibility of changing the status of the order. Currently this status is only saved locally in the offline database.
